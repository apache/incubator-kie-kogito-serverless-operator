// ProfileReconciler is the public interface to have access to this package and perform the actual reconciliation flow.
//
// There are a few concepts in this package that you need to understand before attempting to maintain it:
//
// 1. ProfileReconciler: it's the main interface that internal structs implement via the baseReconciler.
// Every profile must embed the baseReconciler.
//
// 2. stateSupport: is a struct with a few support objects passed around the reconciliation states like the client and logger.
//
// 3. reconciliationStateMachine: is a struct within the ProfileReconciler that do the actual reconciliation.
// Each part of the reconciliation algorithm is a ReconciliationState that will be executed based on the ReconciliationState.CanReconcile call.
//
// 4. ReconciliationState: is where your business code should be focused on. Each state should react to a specific operatorapi.ConditionType.
// The last conditions your state handles, the better. It can provide specific code that will only be triggered if the workflow is in that specific condition.
//
// 5. objectCreator: are functions to create a specific Kubernetes object based on a given workflow instance. This function should return the desired default state.
//
// 6. mutateVisitor: is a function that states can pass to objectEnsurer that will be applied to a given live object during the reconciliation cycle.
// For example, if you wish to guarantee that an image in a specific container in the Deployment that you control and own won't change, make sure that your
// mutate function guarantees that.
//
// 7. objectEnsurer: is a struct for a given objectCreator to control the reconciliation and merge conditions to an object.
// A ReconciliationState may or may not have one or more ensurers. Depends on their role. There are states that just read objects, so no need to keep their desired state.
//
// See the already implemented reconciliation profiles to have a better understanding.
//
// While debugging, focus on the ReconciliationState(s), not in the profile implementation since the base algorithm is the same for every profile.
