## How can I contribute?

There are many ways you can contribute to Kogito Serverless Workflow Operator, not only software development, as well as with the rest of Kogito community:

- Contribute actively to development (see the section below)
- Use it and report any feedback, improvement or bug you may find via Github, mailing list or chat.
- Contribute by writing missing documentation or blog posts about the features around Kogito
- Tweet, like and socialize Kogito in your preferred social network
- Enjoy the talks that the contributors submit in various conferences around the world

## Contributing to the Kogito Serverless Operator codebase

The main project is written in go. 
Kogito Serverless Workflow Operator is built on top of Kubernetes through Custom Resource Definitions.

- Workflow
- Platform
- Build

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster


## Contributing to the Kogito Serverless Operator

### Prerequisites

The Operator's controllers and the configurations are generated using the Operator sdk, the tasks are executed using a Makefile
More information about annotations can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

In order to build the project, you need to comply with the following requirements:

- [operator-sdk-v1.25.0+](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/installation/)
- [Go 1.19+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Kubebuilder 3.7.0+](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/releases)


GNU Make: 
used to define composite build actions. This should be already installed or available as a package (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

### Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use:

- [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) 
- [MINIKUBE](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io)  
- [Openshift Local](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local) 
- [Openshift-developer-sandbox-trial](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-developer-sandbox-trial)

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Test It Out locally

You can launch the operator locally and bind to your cluster.

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use:
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

### How-tos

#### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:
```sh
make manifests
```

#### Building

```sh
make container-build
```

#### Deploy

```sh
make deploy
```

#### Undeploy

```sh
make undeploy
```

### Running the operator on the cluster

See the section on [README](./README.md#getting-started)

### Configuration

A configmap called `kogito-serverless-operator-builder-config` will be created under the `kogito-workflows` namespace when the Operator will be installed, and it contains:

- DEFAULT_BUILDER_RESOURCE = Dockerfile
- DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_EXTENSION = .sw.json
- Dockerfile = `<dockerfile content>`

## Customize Builder Image

At the startup a [Dockerfile](./config/manager/kogito_builder_dockerfile.yaml) is placed in a configmap. This Dockerfile uses a base image called [kogito-swf-builder](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-images/tree/master/modules/kogito-swf-builder) with:

- openjdk 11+
- maven 3.8.6+
- a Quarkus project  `/home/kogito/serverless-workflow-project` with those extensions:
  - quarkus-kubernetes 
  - kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow 
  - kogito-addons-quarkus-knative-eventing
- all the dependencies of Quarkus and the extensions stored in the `/home/kogito/.m2` directory in the image. 


There are, in the base image, some additional scripts in case of need to apply changes like this: 

- add other quarkus extensions in `/home/kogito/launch/add-extension.sh`
- build the project after adding other files/java classes  in `/home/kogito/launch/build-app.sh`
- create a new project in `/home/kogito/launch/create-app.sh`

You can customize your final Image changing the Dockerfile in the configmap kogito-serverless-operator-builder-config accordingly to your specific needs.

# Development status
## General notes
### Workflow CR
- The converter from a KogitoServerlessWorkflow CR to a Kogito compliant JSON ready for the build is supporting only the features that are in the Greeting workflow
- At the moment we are supporting only deployment of services on Kubernetes
### Platform CR
- The only tested features are the ones related to the docker Registry customization and so:
```
       apiVersion: sw.kogito.kie.org/v1alpha08
        kind: KogitoServerlessPlatform
        metadata:
            name: greeting-workflow-platform
        spec:
            cluster: kubernetes
            platform:
                registry:
                    address: <docker registry repository> // the URI to access
                    secret: <name of the secret> // the secret where credentials are stored
                    insecure: true // if the container registry is insecure (ie, http only)
                    ca: <name of the config map> // the configmap which stores the Certificate Authority
                    organization: <name of the org> // the registry organization
```
## Improvements
- Introduce actions into Workflow and Build controller to improve code clarity
- Add Trait to the Platform CR in order to be able to deploy on different context (i.e. KNative)
- Test the Kaniko cache feature
- Improve the workflow converters in order to support all the Kogito Serverless Workflow features
