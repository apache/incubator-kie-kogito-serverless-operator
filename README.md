# Kogito Serverless Operator

The Kogito Serverless Operator is built in order to help the Kogito Serverless users to build and deploy easily on 
Kubernetes/Knative/OpenShift a service based on Kogito that it will be able to execute a workflow.

The CustomResources defined and managed by this operator are the following:
- Workflow 
- Build

# PreRequisites

operator-sdk-v1.24.0

Go 1.19


## Description
The aim of this project is to collect everything is needed for a proof-of-concept of the Kogito Serverless Workflow CRD

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kogito-serverless-operator:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kogito-serverless-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

Minikube or CRC

## Test the Greeting workflow on Minikube

A good starting point to check that everything is working well, it is the [Greeting workflow](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/blob/stable/README.md#serverless-workflow-getting-started).

Follow these steps to create a container that you can than deploy as a Service on Kubernetes or KNative.

1. Start Minikube
```sh 
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 4096 --addons registry --insecure-registry "10.0.0.0/24"
```
2. Create a namespace for the building phase

```sh
kubectl create namespace kogito-builder
```

3. Create a secret
```sh
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=<registry_url> --docker-username=<registry_username> --docker-password=<registry_password> --docker-email=<registry_email> -n kogito-builder
```

4. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make container-build container-push IMG=<some-registry>/kogito-serverless-operator:tag
```

5. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kogito-serverless-operator:tag
```

6. Create a dedicated Namespace for the test:

```sh
kubectl create namespace greeting-workflow
```

7. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/sw.kogito.kie.org__v08_kogitoserverlessworkflow.yaml -n greeting-workflow
```

8. Default configuration

A configmap called kogito-serverless-operator-builder-config will be created under the kogito-serverless-operator-system 
namespace when the Operator will be installer and it contains:
  
- DEFAULT_BUILDER_RESOURCE = kogito_builder_dockerfile.yaml
- DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_DEXTENSION = .sw.json
- DEFAULT_KANIKO_SECRET_DEFAULT = regcred
- DEFAULT_REGISTRY_REPO = quay.io/kiegroup
- kogito_builder_dockerfile.yaml = dockerfile content

For the local development the DEFAULT_REGISTRY_REPO must be changed

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)


#### Local development on Minikube with internal registry 
Start the minikube with
```sh
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 4096 --addons enable registry --insecure-registry "localhost:5000"
```
In the makefile change
IMAGE_TAG_BASE to 
```sh
IMAGE_TAG_BASE ?= localhost:5000/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator
```

in the kustomization.yaml
```sh
DEFAULT_REGISTRY_REPO=<cluster_ip>/kiegroup
```

images.newName to

```sh
newName: localhost:5000/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator
```

##### TODO
In the next iterations the localhost:5000 for the local development will be set at runtime with the ip of the cluster 

DEFAULT_REGISTRY_REPO= in the kustomization.yaml or in the platform will be set using
