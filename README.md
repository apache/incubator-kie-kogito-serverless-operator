# Kogito Serverless Operator

The Kogito Serverless Operator is built in order to help the Kogito Serverless users to build and deploy easily on 
Kubernetes/Knative/OpenShift a service based on Kogito that it will be able to execute a workflow.

The CustomResources defined and managed by this operator are the following:
- Workflow
- Platform
- Build`

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use
- [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind)
- [MINIKUBE](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [CRC](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local)

to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kogito-serverless-operator:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kogito-serverless-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```


## Test the Greeting workflow on Minikube

A good starting point to check that everything is working well, it is the [Greeting workflow](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/blob/stable/README.md#serverless-workflow-getting-started).

Follow these steps to create a container that you can than deploy as a Service on Kubernetes or KNative.

1. Start Minikube
```sh 
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 4096 --addons registry --insecure-registry "10.0.0.0/24"
```
2. Create a namespace for your workflows

```sh
kubectl create namespace kogito-workflows
```

3. Create a secret

This secret will be used by the Operator to push the images built to the desired docker registry.

```sh
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=<registry_url> --docker-username=<registry_username> --docker-password=<registry_password> --docker-email=<registry_email> -n kogito-workflows
```

4. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make container-build container-push IMG=<some-registry>/kogito-serverless-operator:tag
```

5. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kogito-serverless-operator:tag
```

6. Create a Platform containing the configuration (i.e. registry address, secret) for building your workflows:

You can find a basic Platform CR example in the [config](config/samples/sw.kogito_v1alpha08_kogitoserverlessplatform.yaml) folder. 

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/sw.kogito_v1alpha08_kogitoserverlessplatform.yaml -n kogito-workflows
```

7. Build and deploy the Greeting workflow with the Operator

You can find a basic Workflow CR example in the [config](config/samples/sw.kogito_v1alpha08_kogitoserverlessworkflow.yaml) folder.
```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/sw.kogito_v1alpha08_kogitoserverlessworkflow.yaml -n kogito-workflows
```

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`


**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
